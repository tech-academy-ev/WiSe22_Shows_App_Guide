# Introduction
Welcome to the Web Development program for the winter term of 2022/23! We are very excited to have you here. In these first paragraphs we want to briefly introduce our program and give you an overview of what to expect in the following months as well as lay out the content of this guideline. We will help and guide you along the way to the best of our abilities and hope we can share some of that fascination that got us into programming with you!  

Over the next months, there will be a total of four Coding Meetups, spaced out evenly where you will have the ability to meet your peers, work together on our application and ask questions to your mentors. In preparation we partnered up with Udemy and thus you have free access to the ultimate Web Development Bootcamp course. Everything you will learn there, you can later use within your own project and solidify your knowledge. We will go over the course and establish a timeframe on how far you should have progressed before each meetup later on. Feel free to sprint ahead on your own though, we are only laying out the minimal requirements here.  


In your project, you can work in groups of up to four team members. You can choose your teammates independently and we will not interfere with your arrangements. It is however beneficial, that all group members have approximately the same level of knowledge. We explicitly encourage you to collaborate with students from different university faculties. This not only allows you to get to know people from other faculties, but may also give you a whole new perspective on the project and tasks. When submitting your project please note: for a certificate, each person must submit the project individually. However, hand-ins may be similar within your group. You can get more information at our first Coding Meetup on **November 9, 2022.**
  
So.. what is our project? For this term, we have decided to let you create a show app. Just like your favourite streaming platforms Netflix, Disney+ or Amazon Prime. Most of us use these streaming platforms every day and therefore we all know how to use them. But how does the data get to the website? How does it update with every new search and how can one make look that all appealing to an audience? These are all questions that we will tackle in this semester.

This project guide was developed and written by the Web Development team at TechAcademy: [Sebastian Hönig](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sebastian-hönig/), [Burak Onat](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tburakonat/). Special thanks also to Ben Lucht, Feron Basoeki, Tom Schwitzkowski and Tilo Flasche who were responsible for the Web Development course in the past.
